Linear Cryptanalysis
===================

Where I try to implement a linear cryptanalysis attack against a trivial cipher consisting of two S-boxes.

ToDo
====

Clean up the code.
Add permutations, so this is an actual Feistel network.
Add rounds.
Figure out how to chain good approximations to get a good (n-1) round approximation, where n is the number of rounds.
Attack a real cipher, like FEAL, or something.
